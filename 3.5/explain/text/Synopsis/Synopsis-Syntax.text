,       : Separate array, function, verb, or procedure parameters.

;       : Used to separate commands on a single line.

@       : Used within an array-math construct to signify all the
          elements of the array to which the @ is appended.

#       : If the first character in a command line, the rest of the
          command line is ignored and treated as a comment.

\       : Allows input command to be continued on more than one line
          -- must be last character on each line to be continued.

'       : Used to delineate the start and end of strings. 

"       : Used to delineate the start and end of strings.

{ }     : Begins and end an array-math construct.

.       : Decimal point within a number. Example: 1.245 .

<tab>   : Tab key used to indent line; an ignored character.

<space> : Used to separate verbs or parameters in procedure,
	  function, or VERB call.  Sometimes equivalent to a
	  semi-colon, and other times a comma.

<CR>    : When not preceded by a backslash (\), tells UniPOPS to
	  interpret the line just entered and, if no syntactical
	  problems exist, to then execute the commands.

<Ctrl-C>: Tells UniPOPS to abandon what it is processing and
	  allow user to type in a new command.

<Ctrl-U>: When typing in a line, <Ctrl-U> will erase the line;
	  useful if typed line has errors that the user has caught
	  before typing a <CR>.

<Ctrl-D>: Temporarily stops text scrolling on text screen.

<Ctrl-S>: Stops the scrolling of text on the text screen.

<Ctrl-Q>: Starts scrolling of text on text screen after it
	  has been stopped via a <Ctrl-S>.

<Ctrl-R>: Redisplays the line that is currently being typed.

<Ctrl-G>: Rings the computer's bell.  Useful in PRINT
	  statements; for example:  PRINT '<Ctrl-G>'

<Ctrl-Z>: Puts program to sleep temporarily and brings user back to
	  system prompt to execute any UNIX command.  UNIX commands,
	  jobs and fg, will list all sleeping jobs and wake up sleeping
	  jobs, respectively.

Other control characters and keyboard PF keys have special meaning
depending upon the operating system and terminal type in use.  See
system manager for advice on appropriate documentation.
