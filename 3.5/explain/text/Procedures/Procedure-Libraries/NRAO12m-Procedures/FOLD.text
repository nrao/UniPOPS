	FOLD sets FS and FR before calling RAP and then displays the
	result of the RAP.

	RAP requires that FS and FR be set.  Prior to the 1993-1994
	observing season, these two values had to be remembered by
	the observer and entered correctly.  These values are now
	in the data header (as FOFFSIG and FOFFREF1).  FOLD gets these
	values from the header and calls RAP.

	It is therefore not necessary to set FS and FR for current
	12-m data before using RAP.

	Any previously set values of FS and FR will be replaced by
	the values found in the header.

	The data must already be present in Array (0).
