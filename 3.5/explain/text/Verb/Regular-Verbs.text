	Regular verbs are the normal types of verbs.  They do not
	return a value, cannot be used in mathematical expressions,
	cannot appear to the right of an = or PRINT command.  Multiple
	regular verbs can be typed on the same command line and they
	can be used outside and within procedure definition.
