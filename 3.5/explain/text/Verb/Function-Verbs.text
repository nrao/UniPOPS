	Function verbs can be used in mathematical expressions both in
	execute and compile mode and act like the functions found in
	Fortran and C in that they return a value.  The return value
	can be assigned to an adverb or can be printed.  For example:

		PRINT SIN(34)
		X=2+RAND
		XTITLE=CONCAT(YTITLE,'Hello') 

	where SIN, RAND, and CONCAT are functions, X is a scalar
	adverb, and XTITLE and YTITLE are string adverbs.
