	(REGULAR VERB)

	Performs an inverse fast Fourier transform of the  real data in
	Array (0) and the imaginary data in Array (1), placing the real
	and imaginary results back into Arrays (0) and (1),
	respectively.

	ADVERBS USED:

	   BDROP        The number of channels at each end of the
	   EDROP        spectrum which are ignored by the routine.
			The initial values are 0.

	EXAMPLE:

	After an FFT, you want to recover the original data, so
	specify:

		IFFT
