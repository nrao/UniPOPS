	(REGULAR VERB)

	MIFFT performs a two-dimensional inverse fast Fourier transform
	for the real data in Matrix (0) and the imaginary data in
	Matrix (1) stores the real part of the result in Array (0) and
	the imaginary part in Array (1).

	No adverbs are used or set by MIFFT

	EXAMPLE:

	You want to take the inverse FFT of the data in Matrices (0)
	and (1) so type:

		MIFFT

	and you can use CONTOUR to display the results.
