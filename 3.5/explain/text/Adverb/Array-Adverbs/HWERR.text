	(ARRAY ADVERB of 24 elements)

	HWERR is an array containing the one sigma errors in the fitted
	widths of up to 24 Gaussians.  The values of HWERR are
	determined by GAUSS.  The units of HWERR are channel numbers.

	HWERR is not used by any verb.

	HWERR is set by :  GAUSS

	The initial values of HWERR(N) are 0.

	EXAMPLE:

	You have fitted a single Gaussian to your data and now want to
	print out the fitted width and its error:

		PRINT HWIDTH(1), "+/-", HWERR(1)
