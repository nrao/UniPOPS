	(ARRAY ADVERB of 15 elements)

	BPARM is an array which contains the parameters of the
	Chebyshev polynomial most recently derived in baseline
	fitting.  BPARM can also be set by the user for use as
	input to BMODEL or BSHOW.

	BPARM is used by : BMODEL    BSHOW

	BPARM is set by : BASELINE    BSHAPE

	The initial values of BPARM(N) are 0.

	EXAMPLE:

	You have just done a BASELINE and want to see the coefficients
	of the resulting Chebyshev polynomial so you type:

		PRINT BPARM
