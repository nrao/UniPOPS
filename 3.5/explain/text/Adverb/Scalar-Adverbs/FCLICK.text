	(SCALAR ADVERB)

	FCLICK is set by CLICK.  It corresponds to the value that the
	function FCUR would have returned at the crosshair location
	when the user clicks a mouse button.

	For a plot made using SHOW, this is the frequency relative
	to the band center in MHz (LINE) or the time relative to the
	beginning of the scan in seconds (CONDAR), and for a 
	2-d plot, this is the y-axis value.
